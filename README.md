The goal of this tutorial is to make a peptide with any amino acid sequence and shape you like, like for example the one in the picture above. We'll show you how to do it by building a couple of different peptides:

* Example 1: A simple alpha helix made of 10 alanines.
* Example 2: A simple beta strand made of 10 alanines.
* Example 3: A more interesting peptide (several different aminoacids, two different secondary structures.

Then, we can get creative and add any weird atom you want to any peptide:

* Example 4: Add a gold atom to a peptide
* Example 5: Add CAPs to a peptide
